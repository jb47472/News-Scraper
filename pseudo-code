Lots of issues with this homework, I got off to a good start and then hit a wall.

The scraper is working and logging back information, here is a list of things needed to finish the homework asssigment.

Have the button generate the information on the html page.
Use mongoose to manage the relationships between the database and schema in my code. 
Use mongoose to create an article and note div in my html.
Add a delete button for the user to delete comments which would cleat the database.
And of course style the html...which definitley isn't my strong suit.
